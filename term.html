              Website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following
              Terms of Use. These terms outline your rights and obligations when
              using the Website. If you do not agree with these terms, please do
              not use the Website.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>
              By using Weather AC, you confirm that you have read, understood,
              and agreed to these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, and any
              other policies or guidelines we may provide. These terms may be
              updated periodically to reflect changes in law, technology, or
              business practices, and continued use of the Website constitutes
              acceptance of such changes. We encourage you to review these terms
              regularly to stay informed.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use of the Website</h3>
            <p>
              Weather AC provides weather forecasts, data, and related content
              for informational purposes only. You agree to the following
              conditions of use:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use the Website and its services solely for lawful purposes and
                personal or educational use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not engage in any activity that disrupts or interferes with the
                functioning of the Website, including the transmission of
                malicious software, denial-of-service attacks, or other harmful
                actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Websiteâ€™s
                systems, data, or other user accounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not use automated systems, such as bots, crawlers, or scrapers,
                to collect information or data from the Website without our
                express written permission.
              </li>
              <li>
                Acknowledge that Weather AC reserves the right to restrict,
                suspend, or terminate access to users who violate these terms.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Accuracy of Information</h3>
            <p>
              While Weather AC strives to provide accurate and up-to-date
              weather information, conditions can change rapidly, and the data
              may not always be complete or error-free. Weather forecasts and
              reports are inherently subject to uncertainty and should not be
              relied upon for critical decision-making without verifying through
              additional sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, severe weather warnings or alerts may vary depending
              on your location, and we recommend consulting official government
              or local meteorological authorities for immediate safety guidance.
            </p>

              All content, graphics, designs, logos, and data on the Website are
              the property of Weather AC or its licensors and are protected by

            <p>
              You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative
              works, publicly display, or exploit any portion of the Website
